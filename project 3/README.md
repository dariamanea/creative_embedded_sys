# Creative Embedded Systems Kinetic Sculpture Project for COMS3930
Materials Used: 

- 3 ESP32 TTGO T-displays

- 3 Lipo Batteries 

- 3 Servo Motors 

- 3 Stepper Motors

- Solderless Wires 

- Cardboard Sheet

- Tape

- Origami Paper 

- Blue Paint

- Exacto Knife



## The Technical Process

This project was created as a group by me and two other classmates from COMS3930.
The sculpture consists of 6 motors spinning origami pinwheels when a button is pressed on a website. In order to connect to the website, we used the API from here.

Since the project is the collective effort of 3 members, there are 3 ESP32s used, where each ESP32 is connected to 2 motors ( a servo motor and a stepper motor). 

Under the cardboard sheet, the three ESP32s - connected to Wifi and powered by 3.7V Lipo batteries - listen for the status of this website (http://134.122.113.13/uni/). When the button on the website is pressed, the motors turn on for 30 seconds and spin the pinwheels that are taped to the motors. Each pinwheel is taped through the holes made with an Exacto knife to either a stepper motor or a servo motor.

## The Creative Process 

For this project, my teammates and I wanted to make something colorful and create as much movement as possible. All of us agreed that pinwheels are something we found inspiration in when thinking of free, flowy movements. We decided to use origami paper and make pinwheels of different colors. 
The background of the sheet is blue which resembles the sky to inspire the viewer to see the pinwheels as if they are moved by wind.
