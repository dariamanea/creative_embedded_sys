This project was created by running the code inlcuded in the folder on en ESP32 TTGO T-display. The ESP32 was conncted to a charged 3.7V 500 mAh lipo battery through a JST connector. The powered on ESP32 was then taped inside a paper envelope with a cut-out around the screen. The envelope was connected to a wooden stick by a piece of black string. The device was then suspended by having the wooden stick attacehd to the ceiling.

The installation was used as part of a collaborative art project "module #1" which was displayed in the lobby of Barnard's Computational Science Center. The project included 25 suspended devices displaying generative text. Each device was prepared by each student - the process included the folding of the paper, decorating it, soldering the battery to the connector and writing code.
